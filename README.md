### Overview
This graduate level course presents fundamental tools for characterizing data with statistical dependencies over time, and using this knowledge for predicting future outcomes. These methods have broad applications from econometrics to neuroscience. The course emphasizes generative models for time series, and inference and learning in such models. We will cover range of approaches including AR(I)MA, Kalman Filtering, HMMs, Gaussian Processes,  and their application to several kinds of data.

Note: information presented is tentative, syllabus may be subject to change as the course progresses.

### Grading
problem sets (35%) + midterm exam (25%) + final project (25%) + participation (15%). 

### Piazza 
We will use [Piazza]( https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2018/dsga3001008/home) to answer questions and post announcements about the course.  Students' use of Piazza, in particular answering other students' questions well, will contribute to the participation grade.

### Online recordings 
Lecture videos will be posted to NYU Classes. Class attendance is still required.

### Academic honesty

We expect you to try solving each problem set on your own. However, if  stuck  you should discuss things with other students in the class, subject to the following rules:
  - Brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem with other colleagues ok, going together through possible solutions, but should not involve one student telling another a complete solution.
  - Once you solve the homework, you must write up your solutions on your own.
  - You must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed it. This will not affect your grade.
  - Do not consult other people's solutions from similar courses.

#### *Late submission policy*
During the full semester you are allowed a total of maximum of 5 days extension on homework assignments. Each day comes with a  penalty of 20% off your assignment.
